# Machine Learning Lyrics Generator

## Aims

My aims were the implement a LSTM neural network to generate original song lyrics from a dataset I found online.  
I learnt how to use Jupyter Notebooks,  
I learnt how to implement simple machine learning processes using PyTorch.

## Technologies

Python 3.8  
Jupyter Notebooks  
PyTorch


## Usage

Open and run the code inside the Jupyter notebook. The lyrics will be generated using a pre-trained network included in the repo. If you want to retrain the network you have to comment out the load command and uncomment the train_net function call.
